# Introduction

[ðŸš§ Working in Progress](https://github.com/nuxt/learn.nuxt.com#todolist){.text-orange}

This is an interactive tutorial and playground for [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) that runs completely in your browser.

## What's Nuxt?

Nuxt is a free and [open-source framework](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt) with an intuitive and extendable way to create type-safe, performant and production-grade full-stack web applications and websites with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).

We made everything so you can start writing `.vue` files from the beginning while enjoying hot module replacement in development and a performant application in production with server-side rendering by default.

Nuxt has no vendor lock-in, allowing you to deploy your application [**everywhere, even on the edge**](/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge).

## How to use this tutorial?

With this tutorial, we assume you are already familiar with the basic concpet of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).

The [installation of Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation) is already set up for you, so you can focus on learning the concepts of Nuxt.
